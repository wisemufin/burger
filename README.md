# Burger app

I have tried for more than 10 hours to get this working. I have gotten to points where it would log to my table and then it wouldn't. The Heroku link does not work properly so I have the github link only. I would really like to review this with a TA. I struggled a lot with this assignment because of how many layers there are. I worked off of the cat's class file to attempt this. This was the best I could put forth unfortunately. I understand setting up the SQL database and creating routes. When we did the sequelize exercise in class I found that to be much easier to understand than using ORM's. Handlebars is also very difficult for me to understand. I will be setting up a tutor and asking many questions about these concepts in the coming days.
